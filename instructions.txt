1. Right click the "cleaner1.bat" file and select edit. It will open the file with notepad.
2. Once in the file, erase the path between the parentheses, on the line containing the cd command. 
3. Now paste the path to the folder you want to clear.
WARNING: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PATH. THIS WILL DELETE EVERYTHING IN THE FOLDER YOU POINT IT AT!!!
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER ANYTHING DELETED!!!
4. Once you are sure that you have the exact path to the folder you want to clear, save the file.
5. Your batch file is now ready to be run. Right click it and select Run as Administrator.
6. There are some 3 second delays, so you can see the file run. It will execute on its own.
7. Now check the folder whose path you put down. It should be completely empty. If not see troubleshooting below.
8. Now Use Windows Task Scheduler to run the file as frequently as you would like.  
=========================================================================================================
Troubleshooting: 
- If the file does not run, or throws an error. Open a window of cmd by going to run and typing cmd
- The first letter of the prompt should be C: or MATCH the letter of the path you are using.  
- If it doesn't match the path, you will have to change the drive within the batch file.
- Let's assume that the the files you wish to erase are on a drive labelled "X"
- You will then need to add the drive change right before the path. SEE BELOW
