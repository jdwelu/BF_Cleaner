REM Welcome to the Folder Cleaner 
REM This program cleans EVERYTHING from within a folder
REM For this to work for you, simply change two things
REM First you change the Drive Letter to the one where the folder is located
REM Example: [drive letter]: do not include brackets
REM Second you change the path in between the parentheses
REM Example: cd "[your path]" do not include brackets
REM Lastly, change the path in the if exists line to match your path EXACTLY!!!
