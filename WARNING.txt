This batchfile works and works extremely well, however, if not configured right, it will turn your PC into swiss cheese. 
You will lose a lot of data depending on where you house the file.
My best recommendation would be to house it on a thumb drive an run it from there. 
This would sandbox it, in the event anything goes wrong.
I was trying to look at some data while it ran, so I tweaked it a little, and ran from the desktop. 
Something went wrong with the path and it immediately erased all of the files in random folders on the desktop.

YOUR DRIVE PATH HAVE TO BE PERFECT!!!
